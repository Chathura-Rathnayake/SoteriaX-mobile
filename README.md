<h2> UAV Assistance for Water Resuce Operations </h2>
</div>

SoteriaX is an application that is developed to provide real-time lifeguard rescue assistance via an UAV where the operation can be assisted and monitored through our system in a way such that the life critical decision making can be made more proficiently.

## Our Goal

Our main goal is to provide fast action towards a drowning person when identified and to provide support to the rescue operations.
  
## System Objectives
 
-   Providing initial aid via an UAV to a drowning victim until a rescuer arrives at the given location.
-   Establishing real-time communication for rescuers and support teams.
-  Providing features to conduct lifeguard training sessions and analyse statiscial mission data summaries.
- Providing mechanisms to manage lifeguard accounts and handle user inquiries
